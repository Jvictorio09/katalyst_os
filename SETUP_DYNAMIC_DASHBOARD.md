# Dynamic Dashboard Setup Guide

Your dashboard has been successfully converted to use dynamic data! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Been Added

### 1. **Models** (`myApp/models.py`)
- `Tool`: For managing AI tools (Email, Image Gen, Video Gen, etc.)
- `Project`: For tracking projects
- `Activity`: For recent activity feed

### 2. **Views** (`myApp/views.py`)
- Updated `dashboard_view` to load dynamic data
- Added `toggle_tool` for HTMX tool status toggling
- Added `activity_more` for infinite scroll on activities

### 3. **Templates**
- **Updated** `dashboard.html` with HTMX and dynamic loops
- **Created** `_tool_badge.html` - Tool status badge partial
- **Created** `_activity_items.html` - Activity items partial

### 4. **Admin** (`myApp/admin.py`)
- Registered all models with nice admin interfaces
- Added filters, search, and readonly fields

### 5. **Seed Command**
- Created `myApp/management/commands/seed_data.py`
- Seeds demo tools, projects, and activities

## Setup Instructions

Run these commands in your terminal:

### 1. Create Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

### 2. Apply Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Seed Demo Data
```bash
python manage.py seed_data
```

This will create:
- Demo user: `demo@katalyst.local` / `demo12345`
- 6 AI tools
- 3 projects
- 10 recent activities

### 4. Run the Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### 5. Visit Your Dashboard
Open your browser and go to:
- **Login**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/
- **Dashboard**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/
- **Admin**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

## Features Now Working

### âœ… Dynamic Stats Cards
- Active Tools count updates from database
- Projects count updates from database
- Team Members (static for now, you can add a Team model later)

### âœ… AI Tools Grid
- Loops through your tools from the database
- Click the badge to toggle Active/Paused status (HTMX - no page reload!)
- Shows empty state if no tools exist

### âœ… Recent Activity Feed
- Shows last 10 activities
- "Load more" button loads next 10 (infinite scroll with HTMX)
- Color-coded icons based on activity type

### âœ… Admin Panel
- Manage tools, projects, and activities
- Add new items easily
- Search and filter capabilities

## How to Add Your Own Data

### Option 1: Use the Admin Panel (Recommended)
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. Login with your superuser account
3. Add Tools, Projects, Activities

### Option 2: Customize the Seed Command
Edit `myApp/management/commands/seed_data.py` and add your own data, then run:
```bash
python manage.py seed_data
```

## HTMX Features

The dashboard now uses HTMX for dynamic interactions WITHOUT full page reloads:

1. **Tool Toggle**: Click any tool's Active/Paused badge to toggle it
2. **Load More**: Click "Load more" to fetch additional activities

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add Tool Icons**: Update the Tool model to use different icons per tool
2. **Add Team Model**: Create a Team/Member model for real team count
3. **Add Charts**: Use Chart.js or similar for analytics graphs
4. **Tool Actions**: Add click actions to open tools in modals
5. **Project Management**: Add project details and task tracking

## Troubleshooting

### No data showing?
- Make sure you ran migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- Run the seed command: `python manage.py seed_data`

### Tools not toggling?
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure HTMX script is loading (check Network tab)

### Template errors?
- Make sure all partial templates exist in `myApp/templates/`
- Check Django template syntax
